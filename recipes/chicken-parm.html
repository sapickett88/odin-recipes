        <h4>Description:</h4>
        <p>This is a variation of one of the first meals I cooked. Whenever I eat it, 
            it brings back fond memories of being in the kitchen with my step mother.
            It's an easy to make, delicious, Italian classic!</p>

                    <li>1/4 tsp dried oregano</li>

            <h5>To Serve</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>cooked spaghetti</li>
                    <li>2 tbsp sliced fresh basil</li>
                </ul>
            <h4>Steps:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 400F and put a large baking dish to one side</li>
                    <li>Start with the marinara sauce. Heat the olive oil in a medium-
                        sized saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook for 5-6
                        minutes, stirring until softened.</li>
                    <li>Add the garlic and cook until fragrant</li>
                    <li>Add the tomato sauce, oregano, and sugar. Stir and bring to a 
                        boil, then simmer gently for 10 minutes. Turn off heat.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile prepare the chicken. Place the chicken breasts flat on a 
                        board and slice in half through the middle, so you have 4 equal sizes.
                        Dust on both sides with the flour.</li>
                    <li>Add the eggs to a bowl and give them a quick whisk.</li>
                    <li>Add the panko, paprika, salt, pepper, half the parmesan, and the
                         olive oil to a second bowl. Stir until Panko is evenly coated</li>
                    <li>Coat a chicken fillet in the egg, and then dip in panko until 
                        completely covered. Then place in the large baking dish. Repeat
                        This for the remaining 3 fillets</li>
                    <li>Place in the oven for 10 minutes until the breadcrumbs are lightly
                        browned.</li>
                    <li>Top the chicken fillets with the remaining marinara sauce. Arrange 
                        the slices of mozzarella on top of the chicken and sprinkle on the 
                        remaining parmesan and dried oregano.</li>
                    <li>Place back in the oven for 15-20 minutes until the chicken is golden 
                        and piping hot throughout</li>
                    <li>Serve the chicken with cooked spaghetti and sprinkle on fresh basil
                        before serving</li>
                </ol>
