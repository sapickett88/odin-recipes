                </ul>

                </ul>
            <h4>Steps:</h4>
            <h5>Crust</h5>  
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 350F</li>
                    <li>To make the crust, in a medium bowl, mix the chocolate 
                        wafer cookie crumbs and salt.</li>
                    <li> Add the melted butter and mix until the cookie crumbs 
                        are well coated.</li>
                    <li>Sprinkle the cookie crumb mixture in a 9-inch tart pan, 
                        with a little extra around the sides.</li>
                    <li>Press the crumbs on the bottom and sides of the pan 
                        using the heel of your hand or a tart tamper</li>
                    <li>Make sure the crust is even in thickness as possible</li>
                    <li>Blind bake the crust for 8-10 minutes, then place it 
                        on a wire rack and allow it to cool completely. (Blind 
                        bake means to partially cook a pie or tart crust that 
                        has a filling that is cooked for only a short period 
                        of time or not at all</li>
                </ol>
            <h5>Peanut Butter Filling</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, 
                        beat the peanut butter and softened butter until well 
                        mixed</li>
                    <li>Add the confectioners' sugar, salt, and nutmeg and mix 
                        to combine</li>
                    <li>Next, add the milk and vanilla extract and beat until 
                        smooth, about 1 minute.</li>
                    <li>Fill the cooled crust with the peanut butter filling, 
                        leveling it with an offset spatula</li>
                    <li>The crust should extend above the filling slightly 
                        to leave space for the chocolate ganache topping.</li>
                </ol>
            <h5>Chocolate Ganache Topping</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>Melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a 
                        pan of simmering water or a double boiler.</li>
                    <li>Whisk in the heavy cream until smooth</li>
                    <li>Add the butter and corn syrup and whisk until the 
                        butter is melted and the chocolate mixture is smooth.</li>
                    <li>Pour the chocolate mixture on top of the tart, 
                        moving the tart in a tilting motion so the chocolate 
                        runs to the sides and covers the entire top of the 
                        tart.</li>
                        <li>Garnish the edges of the tart with the chopped peanuts.</li>
                        <li>Refrigerate the tart for at least 1 hour and 
                            serve chilled</li>
                        <li>The tart can be made 1 day ahead and stored, covered, 
                            in the refrigerator</li>
                </ol>
