                <ul>
                    <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
                    <li>7oz beef trimmings (ask the butcher to reserve these when
                         trimming the tenderloins)</li>
                    <li>4 large shallots, peeled and sliced</li>
                    <li>12 black peppercorns</li>
                    <li>1 bay leaf</li>
                    <li>1 thyme sprig</li>
                    <li>Splash of re wine vinegar</li>
                    <li>1 750ml bottle of red wine</li>
                    <li>3 cups of beef stock</li>
                    <li>Sea salt and fresh ground black pepper</li>
                </ul>
            <h4>Steps:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Wrap each piece of beef tightly in a triple layer of 
                        plastic wrap to set its shape, then chill overnight.</li>
                    <li>Remove the plastic wrap, then quickly sear the beef in a 
                        hot pan with a little olive oil for 30-60 seconds until 
                        browned all over rare in the middle. Remove from the pan 
                        and leave to cool.</li>
                    <li>Finely chop the mushrooms and saute in a hot pan with a 
                        little olive oil, the thyme leaves, and some sea salt 
                        and pepper. When the mushrooms begin to release their 
                        juices, continue to cook over high heat for about 10 
                        minutes until all the excess moisture has evaporated and 
                        you are left with a mushroom paste (known as a duxelle). 
                        Remove the duxelle from the pan and leave to cool.</li>
                    <li>Cut the pastry in half (if it doesn't already come in 
                        two pieces), place on a lightly floured surface, and roll 
                        into a rectangle large enough to envelope the beef 
                        tenderloins. Chill in the refrigerator.</li>
                    <li>Lay a large sheet of plastic wrap on a work surface and 
                        place 4 slices of Parma ham in the middle, overlapping 
                        them slightly, to create a square. Spread half the duxelle 
                        evenly over the ham.</li>
                    <li>Season the beef tenderloins, then place them on top of the 
                        mushroom-covered ham. Using the plastic wrap, roll the Parma 
                        ham over the beef, then roll and tie the plastic wrap to get 
                        a nice, evenly thick log. Repeat this step for the other 
                        beef tenderloin, then chill for at least 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Brush the pastry with the egg wash. Remove the plastic wrap 
                        rom the beef, then wrap the pastry around each ham-wrapped 
                        tenderloin. Trim the pastry and brush all over with the egg 
                        wash. Cover with plastic wrap and chill for at least 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, make the red wine sauce. Heat the oil in a large pan, 
                        then cook the beef trimmings for a few minutes until browned on 
                        all sides. Stir in the shallots with the peppercorns, bay leaf, 
                        and thyme and continue to cook for about 5 minutes, stirring 
                        frequently, until the shallots turn golden brown.</li>
                    <li>Pour in the vinegar and let bubble for a few minutes until 
                        almost dry, now add the wine and boil until almost completely 
                        reduced. Add the stock and bring to a boil again. Lower the heat 
                        and simmer gently for 1 hour, removing any foam from the surface 
                        of the sauce, until you have the desired consistency. Strain the 
                        liquid through a fine sieve lined with cheesecloth. Check for 
                        seasoning and set aside.</li>
                    <li>When you are ready to cook the beef Wellingtons, score the pastry 
                        lightly and brush with egg wash again, then bake at 400F for 15-20 
                        minutes until the pastry is golden brown and cooked. Rest for 10 
                        minutes before carving.</li>
                    <li>MEanwhile, reheat the sauce. Serve the beef Wellingtons sliced, 
                        with sauce as an accompaniment.</li>
